# Enhance IBM StoredIQ capabilities with new data sources using Connector SDK 

Data is growing exponentially. We are the creators and consumers of data. With this growth of data, organizations find it difficult to manage this effectively. This growth in data has also contributed to new challenges like security, governing and protecting privacy. IBM StoredIQ platform provides powerful solutions for managing unstructured data in-place. It addresses the problems of records management, electronic discovery, compliance, storage optimization, and data migration initiatives. 

Organizations have freedom to choose data sources for their need. It may involve multiple data sources with different versions. A data source can be considered as a location which contains unstructured content. By providing an in-depth assessment of unstructured data where it is, the StoredIQ gives organizations visibility into data to make more informed business and legal decisions. Data Source is an important part for IBM Stored IQ solution. All these features of IBM StoredIQ can be utilized by making a connection between a data source and StoredIQ. The connection between a data source and StoredIQ is established using a connector. Stored IQ provides flexibility to customers to choose data source and it supports 85+ data sources out of the box. Some of the data sources include Box, Microsoft Office 365, FileNet etc. 

The recent release of StoredIQ added a connector-sdk which can be used by business partners and customers to create custom connector for new data sources which StoredIQ does not support. It can also be used to customise and extend existing connector. Once you create a new connector, you can use it to manage data in Stored IQ just like you do it with the supported data sources.

This code pattern helps you to understand the methodology and the steps of building a connector of a new data source. In this pattern, we explain the steps for developing a connector for SVN server data source. When the user has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to develop, integrate, register and test the connector for IBM StoredIQ.

## Flow

## Included Components

* [IBM StoredIQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/overview/overview.html)

* [SVN Server](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/config_svn.htm#MAVEN8824): Subversion is a version control system that keeps track of changes made to files and folders or directories, thus facilitating data recovery and providing a history of the changes that have been made over time.

## Featured Technologies

* [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

## Methodology

The main approach used in developing connector is to find a way to download all the content of desired data source into the IBM  StoredIQ data server. Once all the files are downloaded, an user can harvest (index) to see all the content of data source in StoredIQ suite and information set(infoset) gets created. This infoset can be used to provide insight into an organizationâ€™s unstructured content at a given point in time.

## Pre-requisites

* [IBM StoredIQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/overview/overview.html) Product: Refer this [link](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHEC_7.6.0/deploy/cpt/cpt_installation_siqplatform.html) to install IBM StoredIQ.
*	IBM StoredIQ Connector API SDK: After the product installation, you will find Connector API SDK at `/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/` in StoredIQ Data server ????.
*	[Python version 2.6](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/)
* [SVN Server](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/config_svn.htm#MAVEN8824): Setup SVN server.

## Steps

### 1. Develop the IBM StoredIQ Connector by using Connector API SDK

Once the user have installed StoredIQ Connector, the user will have a folders named as sample_connector and siq_connector. The siq_connector contains python modules that will act as a template for developing a new connector.
Sample_connector contains an implementation of connector for NFSv3 file system. To make the development of connector simpler, we will modify this folder contents in this code pattern. We will rename the folder name relevant to new connector name. In our case we will rename it to tsvn_connector. This folder will be containing following python modules:
* __init__.py
* sample_attributes.py
* sample_conn.py
* sdk_version.py
Avoid making any changes to __init__.py and sdk_version.py.
